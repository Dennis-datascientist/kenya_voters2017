# Kenyan County Voter Distribution Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing and visualizing the distribution of voters in various counties of Kenya. The analysis is performed using Python and the Pandas library for data manipulation, and the Matplotlib library for data visualization.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to understand the distribution of voters across different counties in Kenya. We use Python and Pandas to process and analyze the data, and Matplotlib to create visualizations for a better understanding of the data.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

Open and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see the analysis and visualizations.
Data

The data used for this analysis is sourced from a dataset containing voter information for different counties in Kenya.

The dataset includes columns such as county code, county name, number of voters, and polling stations.

## Code
The analysis and visualizations are implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. 

The code showcases data processing, filtering, sorting, and visualization techniques using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Results
The results of the analysis are visualized through different types of plots, such as bar charts and radar plots. 

These visualizations help in understanding the voter distribution across various counties in Kenya.
